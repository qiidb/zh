These approaches to software engineering have the potential to revolutionize software development as automation and components revolutionized manufacturing. The conference brings together researchers and practitioners interested in adva- ing automation for software development. It is also a premier forum for cro- fertilization between the programming language and software engineering - search communities.

The proceedingsofthepreviousGPCEconferenceswerepublishedintheLNCSseries of Springer as volumes2487,2830,and 3286.In 2005 GPCE wasco-locatedwith the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) and the s- posium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP), re?ecting the vigorous interaction between the functional programming and generative programming research communities. GPCE and ICFP are both sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery. The quality and breadth of the papers submitted to GPCE 2005 was impr- sive. All 86 papers, including 5 papers for tool demonstrations, were rigorously reviewed by 17 highly quali?ed Program Committee members. The members of the Program Committee ?rst provided in-depth individual reviews of the s- mitted papers, and then debated the merits of the papers through an extended electronicProgramCommitteemeeting.After much(friendly) argument,25r- ular papers and 2 tool demonstration papers were selected for publication. The ProgramCommittee provided extensive technical feedback to the authors of the submittedpapers.Theconferenceprogramwascomplementedwiththreeinvited talks, three extended tutorials, and three all-day workshops."> <meta property="og:description" content="Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE) is a leading research conference on automatic programming and component engineering.
