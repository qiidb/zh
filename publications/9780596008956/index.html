Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It’s reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn’t solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively. Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution. How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is “transparent” encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique “tunneling” capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration. Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you’re an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks. No matter where or how you’re shipping information, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide will show you how to do it securely."> <meta property="og:description" content="Are you serious about network security?
