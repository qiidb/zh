He chain-smoked cigarettes, popped pills, and was angry and depressed. But when he discovered that his mother kept a record of almost every detail of his childhood, an idea began to form. Could knowing the status of every aspect of his body and how his lifestyle affected his health help him learn to take care of himself? By harnessing the story of his life, could he learn to harness his own bad habits? With a little tech know-how combined with a healthy dose of reality, every app, sensor, and data point in Dancy’s life was turned upside down and examined. Now he’s sharing what he knows. That knowledge includes the fact that changing the color of his credit card helps him to use it less often, and that nostalgia is a trigger for gratitude for him. A modern-day story of rebirth and redemption, Chris’ wisdom and insight will show readers how to improve their lives by paying attention to the relationship between how we move, what we eat, who we spend time with, and how it all makes us feel. But Chris has done all the hard work: Don’t Unplug shows us how we too can transform our lives."> <meta property="og:description" content="Chris Dancy, the world’s most connected person, inspires readers with practical advice to live a happier and healthier life using technologyIn 2002, Chris Dancy was overweight, unemployed, and addicted to technology.
